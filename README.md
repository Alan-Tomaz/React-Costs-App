The site allows you to create projects and set a budget for them, and edit or remove them at any time.

Based on the project created, it is possible to define services linked to them, which will have costs that will be related to the total budget defined for the project. It is possible to edit the service to change its information such as its cost, or remove it

To create the project, tools such as React Fragments, CSS modules, useState Hook and concepts such as conditional rendering, State Lift and componentization were used.
